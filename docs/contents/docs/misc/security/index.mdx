Security is a fundamental pillar of our platform. We take a proactive approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential vulnerabilities across our entire infrastructure. Our commitment extends from secure development practices to comprehensive container image scanning and continuous monitoring.

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

We implement comprehensive Static Application Security Testing across all our applications and container images. Our security pipeline includes:

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning

All container images undergo rigorous security scanning using **Trivy**, an industry-leading vulnerability scanner that detects:

- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Language-specific package vulnerabilities  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security issues
- Container image misconfigurations
- License compliance issues

### Scanning Frequency

- **Pre-deployment**: All images are scanned before being pushed to production
- **Continuous monitoring**: Regular scans of deployed images to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities
- **Dependency updates**: Automated scanning triggered by dependency changes

## Container Image Security Reports

Below you'll find links to our latest security scan reports and container image information:

### Production Images

| Service | Image Repository | Latest Scan Report | Vulnerability Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Observer | `public.ecr.aws/l5a6x1y4/aiostack-observer:latest` | [View Report](#) | ✅ No Critical Issues |
| Commander| `public.ecr.aws/l5a6x1y4/aiostack-commander:latest` | [View Report](#) | ✅ No Critical Issues |
