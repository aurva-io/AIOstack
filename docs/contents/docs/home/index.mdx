**AI Observability Stack** is an open-source observability tool that automatically discovers, traces, and monitors AI/ML workloads running in Kubernetes clusters. Using eBPF technology, it provides deep visibility into LLM API calls, ML library usage, and AI agent behavior without requiring code changes or application restarts.

## üöÄ Features

- **Zero-instrumentation tracing**: Automatic detection of AI/ML libraries and LLM calls by workloads using eBPF
- **Kubernetes-native**: One click deploy as DaemonSet with RBAC and security best practices. One click uninstall.
- **Multi-runtime support**: Python, Node.js, Java, and Go applications
- **LLM provider coverage**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, and more
- **ML library detection**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, transformers, langchain
- **Real-time dashboards**: Built-in Grafana dashboards and Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics metrics
- **Real-Time Shadow AI Detection**: Identify unsanctioned AI tool usage and LLM calls from unexpected sources
- **Agent workflow visualization**: Trace multi-step AI agent executions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

// TODO: Add architecture diagram

## üìã Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.24+ with eBPF support ( EKS, GKE, AKS, etc. )
- Linux kernel 4.18+ (5.4+ recommended)

## Why use Documents?

This kit was built to simplify how teams manage and publish documentation. It works across projects of all sizes‚Äîfrom a single
readme to enterprise knowledge bases.

With MDX, reusable components, and Tailwind styling, it keeps your workflow efficient without compromising flexibility.

Use it for:

- **Product Guides** ‚Äì Setup, usage, and troubleshooting
- **Internal Docs** ‚Äì Processes, policies, and team references
- **Technical Manuals** ‚Äì APIs, SDKs, architecture walkthroughs

Customize the UI and structure to match your brand or workflow‚Äîno lock-in.
