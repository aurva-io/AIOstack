**AI Observability Stack** or AIOStack is an open-source observability tool that automatically discovers, 
traces, and monitors AI/ML workloads running in Kubernetes clusters. Using eBPF technology, it provides deep visibility into LLM API calls, ML library usage, and AI agent behavior without requiring code changes or application restarts.

## Features

- **Zero-instrumentation tracing**: Automatic detection of AI/ML libraries and LLM calls by workloads using eBPF
- **Kubernetes-native**: One click deploy as DaemonSet with RBAC and security best practices. One click uninstall.
- **Multi-runtime support**: Python, Node.js, Java, and Go applications
- **LLM provider coverage**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, and more
- **ML library detection**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, transformers, langchain
- **Real-time dashboards**: Built-in Grafana dashboards and Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics metrics
- **Real-Time Shadow AI Detection**: Identify unsanctioned AI tool usage and LLM calls from unexpected sources
- **Agent workflow visualization**: Trace multi-step AI agent executions



## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.24+ with eBPF support ( EKS, GKE, AKS, etc. )
- Linux kernel 4.18+ (5.4+ recommended)
- Helm 3.0+ (for installation)
- Cluster admin privileges for eBPF programs
