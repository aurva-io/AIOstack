## **Observer: The Foundation of AI Visibility**

The **Observer** is a lightweight agent that runs on every node in the Kubernetes cluster as a **DaemonSet**. Its role is to provide continuous, system-wide visibility into AI/ML activity without requiring developers to modify their applications.

At its core, the Observer uses **eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)** â€” a Linux kernel technology that allows safe, efficient monitoring of low-level system events such as file access, network communication, and process behavior. Unlike traditional monitoring approaches that depend on application-level instrumentation, eBPF enables us to see what processes are actually doing in real time, directly from the kernel.

Because the Observer runs at this level, it has several key advantages:

* **Unbiased visibility**: It observes whatâ€™s really happening on the node, not just what applications report.
* **Zero friction**: It requires no code changes, no libraries, no developer intervention.
* **Comprehensive coverage**: Every container and process is monitored automatically, whether itâ€™s training models, running inference, or calling external APIs.
* **Real-time detection**: Observations are captured as they occur, allowing downstream systems to enrich traffic and build an accurate inventory of AI usage.

### **What the Observer Does**

* **Monitors processes**: Tracks which workloads are engaging in AI/ML activities (training, inference, agent communication, etc.).
* **Connects system events to AI context**: Correlates local activities (like loading frameworks or models) with outbound communications (such as API calls to OpenAI or Hugging Face).
* **Feeds structured intelligence upstream**: Sends enriched, AI-aware telemetry to the Commander and ClickHouse for storage, querying, and visualization.

ðŸ‘‰ In short, the Observer acts as the **eyes and ears of the AI observability stack**. By leveraging eBPF and running as a DaemonSet, it ensures **full coverage across the cluster**, making invisible AI workloads visible â€” all in real time, and without requiring trust in self-reported application data.
