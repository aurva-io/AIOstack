### The Security Team's Nightmare

At 3 AM, your phone buzzes. The headline reads: *"Major Enterprise Exposed Customer Data Through AI Chatbot Integration."*

You think: *"That could never be us. We have policies."*

But do you know about the new Chat Interface your summer interns just built? The one that's been sending code snippets (with API keys) to OpenAI for autocompletion?

Do you know about the "image optimization service" that's actually running Stable Diffusion on customer photos?

Do you know about the CI/CD pipeline that queries ChatGPT to write deployment scripts based on your infrastructure configs?

**Your policies don't protect against threats you can't see.**

### Why Traditional Monitoring Fails

**Traditional monitoring tools only reveal what they’re told.** They depend on instrumentation and cooperation.

**AI is different.** It doesn’t announce itself - but that’s where the opportunity lies. A Python script importing TensorFlow looks identical to one importing requests. An OpenAI API call masquerades as any other HTTPS request. A local ML model can disguise itself as a web service.

**The story of AI in infrastructure is one of hidden potential.** It’s everywhere, often invisible, shaping workflows and decisions in ways that standard tools can’t capture

### At Last, AI Observability That Actually Observes

We built AIOStack to bring clarity where traditional tools fall short.

Our eBPF agents operate at the kernel level—giving you visibility deeper than applications, broader than network monitoring, and more precise than conventional scanners.

**No extra instrumentation. No blind spots.** Just an accurate picture of how AI is being used.

From TensorFlow imports to Hugging Face downloads, from OpenAI requests to local model inferences—we make the invisible visible.

In real time. Across every container. On every node. **Without changing a single line of code.**

### Your AI Attack Surface Is Larger Than You Think

The average enterprise has more AI applications than their security team knows about.

The average security incident isn't detected until it's too late.

### So, Don't Be Tomorrow's Headline

Every day you operate blind to your AI landscape, you're one API call away from a breach that could have been prevented.

The question isn't whether your organization has shadow AI.

**The question is: do you want to find it before the headlines do?**
