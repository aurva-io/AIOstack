### The Security Team's Nightmare

At 3 AM, your phone buzzes. The headline reads: *"Major Enterprise Exposed Customer Data Through AI Chatbot Integration."*

You think: *"That could never be us. We have policies."*

But do you know about the new Chat Interface your summer interns just built? The one that's been sending code snippets (with API keys) to OpenAI for autocompletion?

Do you know about the "image optimization service" that's actually running Stable Diffusion on customer photos?

Do you know about the CI/CD pipeline that queries ChatGPT to write deployment scripts based on your infrastructure configs?

**Your policies don't protect against threats you can't see.**

### Why Traditional Monitoring Fails

Application monitoring tools like Datadog and New Relic see what developers want them to see. They require instrumentation. They depend on cooperation. They trust what they're told.

**But AI doesn't announce itself.**

A Python script importing TensorFlow looks identical to one importing requests. An OpenAI API call masquerades as any other HTTPS request. A local ML model disguises itself as a web service.

**The most dangerous AI in your infrastructure is the AI that doesn't want to be found.**

### At Last, AI Observability That Actually Observes

We built AIOStack because we were tired of security tools that couldn't secure what they couldn't see.

Our eBPF agents work at the kernel level - deeper than applications, smarter than network monitoring, more thorough than any security scanner you've ever used.

We don't ask permission. We don't require cooperation. We don't trust what we're told.

**We see what is, not what's reported.**

Every TensorFlow import. Every Hugging Face download. Every ChatGPT conversation. Every local model inference. Every AI library call.

In real-time. Across every container. On every node. Without changing a single line of application code.

### Your AI Attack Surface Is Larger Than You Think

The average enterprise has more AI applications than their security team knows about.

The average security incident isn't detected until it's too late.

### Don't Be Tomorrow's Headline

Every day you operate blind to your AI landscape, you're one API call away from a breach that could have been prevented.

The question isn't whether your organization has shadow AI.

**The question is: do you want to find it before the headlines do?**
